Compatibility Issues
--------------------
- Due to the USB and wave audio properties update, users may experience no audio
  on USB at first connect. This is a Windows issue. Please follow workaround steps 
  from the Wiki when switching to this version of software:

- Due to changes to the default gateway and IP addresses, static IPs for Ethernet audio must be updated:

  Going forward - Ethernet IP and Gateway addresses can be retrieved by running the syslog command
